Usage of These Classes Together

* WebAppInitializer: This class is responsible for bootstrapping your Spring MVC application by configuring the DispatcherServlet,
  which is the core servlet that handles all incoming requests. It loads the root configuration (WebRootConfig)
  and web configuration (WebAppConfig).

* WebAppConfig: This is where your web-related configuration is handled. It enables Spring MVC via @EnableWebMvc
  and scans your packages for annotated components like controllers (HelloWebMVC).

* HelloWebMVC: This is your REST controller, which handles the actual incoming HTTP requests
  (mapped by @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc.). When a request hits /hello/*, Spring routes it to the appropriate method
  based on the HTTP method and URL.

* WebRootConfig: This is a placeholder for the root application context.
  Itâ€™s empty now, but in larger applications, it would configure non-web-related beans like services or database connections.
