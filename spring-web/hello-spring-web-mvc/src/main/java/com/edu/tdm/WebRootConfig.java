 * Purpose: This class is a placeholder for the root application context configuration.
 * Typically, you use this class to configure beans that are shared across your entire application (like services, repositories, etc.).
 * Empty for Now: Since it’s currently empty, it’s not doing much, but later on, you might configure data sources,
 * transaction management, or security here.
