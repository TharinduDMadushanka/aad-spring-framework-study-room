<!--        Purpose: In a traditional Spring application, the web.xml file serves as the deployment descriptor for your web application, -->
<!--        providing details on how to initialize servlets, filters, listeners, etc.-->
<!--        Empty in Your Case: Since you're using Java-based configuration (WebAppInitializer), you donâ€™t need to configure anything in-->
<!--        web.xml. It's just an empty placeholder, as you are leveraging annotations and Java classes for the configuration.-->
